**General Principles**

1. Keep it simple! Reduce complexity as much as possible.
2. Be consistent in your approach. If you do something a certain way, do similar things the same way.
3. Always look for the root cause of problems, not just symptoms.
4. Leave the code better than you found it. (The "Boy Scout Rule")
5. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. (Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS) principle)
8. Aim for simple, idiomatic, readable code. Reduce complexity as much as possible.
9. Always Define Types for type safety.
11. Adapt to the Code Environment. For example, if TailwindCSS is used, use only TailwindCSS for styling.
12. Break problems into smaller parts. Face the problem always step by step.

**Naming & Formatting**

1. Use descriptive, unambiguous, pronounceable names.
2. Make meaningful distinctions between similar concepts.
3. Replace magic numbers with named constants.
4. Keep lines of code short and readable.
5. Use whitespace and indentation to show hierarchical relationships.

**Functions**

1. Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
2. Use descriptive names that clearly convey the function's purpose.
3. Prefer fewer arguments. Consider wrapping multiple arguments in an object.
4. Avoid side effects! Functions should not rely on or modify external state.

**Objects & Classes**

1. Hide internal structure and implementation details.
2. Prefer simple data structures to complex objects when possible.
3. Avoid mixing data and functionality. Keep objects small and focused.
4. Base classes should know nothing about their derivatives.

**Comments**

1. Try to explain yourself in code first. Good code often minimizes the need for comments.
2. Don't just repeat what the code does. Focus on intent and rationale.
3. Use comments to clarify confusing code and warn of consequences.
4. Don't comment out code and leave it. Just delete unused code.

**Avoid Code Smells**
Be on the lookout for these common signs of problematic code:

- Rigidity: Small changes require many other changes
- Fragility: Code breaks in multiple places with every change
- Needless complexity, repetition, or opacity
- Tight coupling that makes code hard to reuse
